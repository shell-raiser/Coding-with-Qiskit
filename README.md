### Coding with Qiskit, the YT series
Following tutorials from the series [ðŸ–¥ Qiskit Algorithms - Coding with Qiskit Season 2](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvrhKYASly1BXo1AdPyoCsor) and [ðŸ’» Qiskit Foundations - Coding with Qiskit Season 1](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY)

### 1 min qiskit

Snippets from the [1 min qiskit playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvpOCmJ9BonUhf7NYB4d1p0e)<br>
These are not complete code, each cell represents a video's content. The variable names are changed to keep things coonsistent with my learning.

### NPTEL Notes
Some notes from the [Introduction to Quantum Computing: Quantum Algorithms and Qiskit](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs103/preview) course, great for understanding the theory.
